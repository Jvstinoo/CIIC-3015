'''Write a function called Summation() that accepts two integers m and n (where m â‰¤ n)
 and returns the sum of all numbers from m to n. For example,  with m=2 and n=6 it should
  return 20, since 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 20

Notes: You can assume that the first number will be less than or equal to 
the second number. You must use loops.
