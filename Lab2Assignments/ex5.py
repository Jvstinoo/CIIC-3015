'''Write a program which asks the user to input an integer. 
Print the digit which appears in the hundreds place for that number. 
So, for an input of 1234 you would print a 2. For an input of 987 you 
would print a 9. For an input of 36 you would print a 0. For an input 
of 1937560 you would print a five. (Hint: Review the list of Python 
arithmetic operators from last week. There are seven of them. You will
 need to use two.)'''


number = int(input('Enter a number: '))


print(number % 1000//100)
