'''When we define functions, we can use the return statement to return a value. However, 
sometimes it would be useful to '
return multiple values, and a tuple is the perfect structure to do so. Although we could
 accomplish the same thing with a list, but a list is a better fit if outside of the function
  call we still want to keep the values together, whereas a tuple is better if we're only "packaging" 
  them together for the sake of returning multiple values.

Task
Write a function named min_max that receives a list of numbers as a parameter and returns a tuple 
that contains the minimum value and the maximum value (in that order) of the list. For example, if the 
list is [2, 5, 3.14, -6, 1], then the function should return (-6, 5).

Hint: You may use list functions or methods that you already know, but you must not modify the original list.

Note: You will need to invoke your function to test it, but in the answer field only include your function
 definition (don't include the function call).'''
