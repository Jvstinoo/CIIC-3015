'''Write a function called Primes() which takes an int and returns a sorted list containing all prime numbers (as ints) 
which are less than that value.

You are specifically required to implement an algorithm called the Sieve of Eratosthenes, which works as follows:

1) Let N be the value of the function argument. (You don't need to call your own variable N. This is merely for explanation purposes.)
2) Let S be a list of N bools. These represent potential primes. We have yet to eliminate any candidates so initially they are all set to True.
3) Let J be the current number that we wish to test for primality. Initially J=2.
4) Let P be the list of primes that we will be returning to the caller. Initially P is empty.
5) If J >= N then return P.
6) If S[J] is True then J is a prime number so do the following:
        Append J to P
        Set S[M] to False for all M that are multiples of J and less than N. (So for N=10 and J=2, set S[2], S[4], S[6], S[8] to False.)
7) Increment J by one and then go back to step 5.

Note: Do not try to just blindly copy this algorithm exactly as it is written above line-by-line. Instead, understand how 
it all works and then translate that understanding into effective Python statements.'''
